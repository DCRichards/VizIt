# VizIt

A simple dependency visualisation project

## About

VizIt represents dependencies in programming languages using a network graph. This project exists for a number of reasons:

* To help me learn Python
* To actually be useful in visualising dependencies 
* ...um, because I just like programming

## Examples

Usage and more detailed information coming soon. For now, here's an example from the prototype:

Python isn't my main language so if you think you've found a bug or just want to help me improve then submit an issue or pull request.
