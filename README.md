# VizIt

A simple dependency visualisation project

## About

VizIt represents dependencies in programming languages using a network graph. This project exists for a number of reasons:

* To help me learn Python
* To actually be useful in visualising dependencies 
* ...um, because I just like programming

## Setup

Install dependencies:

    sudo pip install networkx
    
Run the setup script:

    python setup.py

## Libraries

* [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/overview.html)

## Contributing

Python isn't my main language so if you think you've found a bug or just want to help me improve then submit an issue or pull request.
